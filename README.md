React CRUD Database

A CRUD database is a type of database that allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data records. It is a standard approach for managing persistent data storage in software applications.

npm i react-scripts (This package includes scripts and configuration used by Create React App)

Note that when using the "Api" folder, it should be separated into the "React-API-Project-main" folder or simply placed inside the HTDOCS folder. Incorrectly specifying the directory folder can potentially cause errors in the code. If you want to change the directory of the folder, you should also update the directory inside the "Add user", "Edit user," and "User list" components.

It return also the data in JSON format from each end point. Each end point can be modified easily with mysql requests and php functions to return particular requests as needed
